//Java Program to demonstrate why we need method overriding  
//Here, we are calling the method of parent class with child  
//class object.  
//Creating a parent class 

class Vehicle{  
  void run(){System.out.println("Vehicle is running");}  
} 

//Creating a child class  

class Bike extends Vehicle{  
  public static void main(String args[]){  
  //creating an instance of child class  
  Bike obj = new Bike();  
  //calling the method with child class instance  
  obj.run();  
  }  
  
} 

// Output will be 
 Vehicle is running
 
// Problem is that I have to provide a specific implementation of run() method in subclass that is why we use method overriding.
// means we may want to modify the implementation of the run method in the child class as below

//Creating a parent class.  
class Vehicle{  
  //defining a method  
  void run(){System.out.println("Vehicle is running");}  
}  
//Creating a child class  
class Bike2 extends Vehicle{  
  //defining the same method as in the parent class  
  void run(){System.out.println("Bike is running safely");}  
  
  public static void main(String args[]){  
  Bike2 obj = new Bike2();//creating object  
  obj.run();//calling method  
  }  
}  

// the output will be 
Bike is running safely
