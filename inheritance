// inheritance is the mechanism in which child class object   acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object

// example Employee class is the parent class which other classes can inherit 
class Employee{ 

 float salary=40000;  
} 

// Programmer class is the child class which extends Employee class
class Programmer extends Employee{  

 int bonus=10000;  
 public static void main(String args[]){  

//create an object of programmer class 
   Programmer p=new Programmer();  
   // now you can access the properties and behaviour of parent class through the child class object
   // as showed below 
   System.out.println("Programmer salary is:"+p.salary);  
   System.out.println("Bonus of Programmer is:"+p.bonus);
